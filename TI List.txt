List of Training Images:

* "ti_binary.mat"
This image is a 2-D binary which represents a reservoir consisting of shale and sand with sinusoidal channels, is used as the TI.

* "ti_longrange.mat"
This training image is a simple binary image having long-range features.

* "ti_categorical.mat"
The training image represents the ground penetrating radar (GPR) data of a fluvioglacial aquifer. This dataset is from Herten site that is located in Rhine River in Germany, near Basel in Switzerland.

* "ti_continuous.mat"
This image is a stonewall which represents a number of stones with narrow channels in between.

* "ti_3D.mat"
This training image is a binary image which shows 3D folds.

It should be mentioned that all of this TIs are borrowed from the websites:

* "Is.mat"
As an example for a simulation grid containing hard data this file contains 100 hard data for the binary case.
